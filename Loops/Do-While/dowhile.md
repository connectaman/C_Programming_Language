### do while loop in C

------
The do while loop is a post tested loop. Using the do-while loop, we can repeat the execution of several parts of the statements. The do-while loop is mainly used in the case where we need to execute the loop at least once. The do-while loop is mostly used in menu-driven programs where the termination condition depends upon the end user.

##### Infinitive do while loop

The do-while loop will run infinite times if we pass any non-zero value as the conditional expression.
```objectivec
        do{  
        //statement  
        }while(1);  
```
