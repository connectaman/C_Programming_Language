### Features of C Language

-------

C is the widely used language. It provides many features that are given below.

    1- Simple
    2- Machine Independent or Portable
    3- Mid-level programming language
    4- structured programming language
    5- Rich Library
    6- Memory Management
    7- Fast Speed
    8- Pointers
    10- Recursion
    11- Extensible

---------

##### 1) Simple

C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), the rich set of library functions, data types, etc.

-------

##### 2) Machine Independent or Portable

Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed on different machines with some machine specific changes. Therefore, C is a machine independent language.
--------

##### 3) Mid-level programming language

Although, C is intended to do low-level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as kernel, driver, etc. It also supports the features of a high-level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.

-----------

##### 4) Structured programming language

C is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify. Functions also provide code reusability.

--------

##### 5) Rich Library

C provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.

--------

##### 6) Memory Management

It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C language, we can free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.

----------

##### 7) Speed

The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.

---------

##### 8) Pointer

C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array, etc.

---------

##### 9) Recursion

In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.

-------

##### 10) Extensible

C language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.
