### If else-if ladder Statement

-------

The if-else-if ladder statement is an extension to the if-else statement. It is used in the scenario where there are multiple cases to be performed for different conditions. In if-else-if ladder statement, if a condition is true then the statements defined in the if block will be executed, otherwise if some other condition is true then the statements defined in the else-if block will be executed, at the last if none of the condition is true then the statements defined in the else block will be executed. There are multiple else-if blocks possible. It is similar to the switch case statement where the default is executed instead of else block if none of the cases is matched.

```objectivec
    if(condition1){  
    //code to be executed if condition1 is true  
    }else if(condition2){  
    //code to be executed if condition2 is true  
    }  
    else if(condition3){  
    //code to be executed if condition3 is true  
    }  
    ...  
    else{  
    //code to be executed if all the conditions are false  
    }  
```
