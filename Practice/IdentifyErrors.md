### Practice 

--------

Identify any erroneous or missing components in the following functions:

-------

1- 

```objectivec
void main(){
    printf(" This function seems to be okay ")
}
```

----------

2- 

```objectivec
void main(){)
    //prints the line
    printf("This function is perfect ";
}
```

---------

3- 

```objectivec
void main()
}
    printf("This has got to be right");
{
```

---------

4- 

```objectivec
void main(){
    This is a perfect comment line 
    printf("Is It Okay?");
}
```
-----------


Solutions:

1- Semi-Colon is missing at the end of the printf() function

2- ')' missing at the end of the printf() functions

3- '}' instead of '{' for making the beginning of the functions,
    '{' instead of '}' for making the end of the functions
    
4- Comment line should begin with //
