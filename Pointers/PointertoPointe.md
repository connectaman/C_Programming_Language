### C Double Pointer (Pointer to Pointer)

-----

As we know that, a pointer is used to store the address of a variable in C. Pointer reduces the access time of a variable. However, In C, we can also define a pointer to store the address of another pointer. Such pointer is known as a double pointer (pointer to pointer). The first pointer is used to store the address of a variable whereas the second pointer is used to store the address of the first pointer. Let's understand it by the diagram given below.

The syntax of declaring a double pointer is given below.
```objectivec
    int **p; // pointer to a pointer which is pointing to an integer.      
```
