### realloc() function in C

If memory is not sufficient for malloc() or calloc(), you can reallocate the memory by realloc() function. In short, it changes the memory size.

Let's see the syntax of realloc() function.
```objectivec
    ptr=realloc(ptr, new-size)  
```

### free() function in C

The memory occupied by malloc() or calloc() functions must be released by calling free() function. Otherwise, it will consume memory until program exit.

Let's see the syntax of free() function.
```objectivec
    free(ptr)  
```
