### Programs on Loops

----

1- C Program to Calculate the Sum of Natural Numbers

```
The positive numbers 1, 2, 3... are known as natural numbers. The programs below takes a positive integer (let say n) as an input from the user and calculates the sum up to n.
```

-----

2- C Program to Find Factorial of a Number

```
The factorial of a positive number n is given by:

factorial of n (n!) = 1*2*3*4....n

The factorial of a negative number doesn't exist. And, the factorial of 0 is 1, 0! = 1
```

3- C Program to Generate Multiplication Table

![tables](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/multiplication-table.jpg)

The output must be similar to this
```
Enter an integer: 9
9 * 1 = 9
9 * 2 = 18
9 * 3 = 27
9 * 4 = 36
9 * 5 = 45
9 * 6 = 54
9 * 7 = 63
9 * 8 = 72
9 * 9 = 81
9 * 10 = 90
```

------

4- C Program to Display Fibonacci Sequence

```
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where the next term is the sum of pervious two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence is 0 followed by 1.

The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

```

5- C Program to Display Characters from A to Z Using Loop

```
Expected Output
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
```

-------

6- C Program to Count Number of Digits in an Integer

-------

7- C Program to Check Whether a Number is Palindrome or Not

```
An integer is a palindrome if the reverse of that number is equal to the original number.
```

8- Program to print half pyramid using *

```
The Generated Output should be Similar to 
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```
------

9- Program to print half pyramid a using numbers

```
The Generated Output should be Similar to 
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

10- Programs to print inverted half pyramid using * and numbers


```
The Generated Output should be Similar to 
* * * * *
* * * *
* * * 
* *
*
```

----

11- Inverted half pyramid using numbers

```
The Generated Output should be Similar to 
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3
1 2
1
```

------

12- Create a C program, which calculates the triangualr number of the user's request, read from the keyboard using scanf(). A triangular number is the sum of the preceeding numbers, so the traingular number 7 has the value of 7+6+5+4+3+2+1 (same as a factorial in mathematics, for example , factorial of 7 --- !7).

```
Enter the number: 7
7*6*5*4*3*2*1=
```
